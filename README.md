# Image-Processing-Self-Driving-Cars
### Educational Project 2022

### Phase 1 - Lane Line detection:
Expected output:
For the first phase, the expected output is as follows:
- Your pipeline should be able to detect the lanes, highlight them using a fixed color, and pain the area between them in any color you like (it’s painted green in the image above.)
- You’re required to be able to roughly estimate the vehicle position away from the center of the lane.
- As a bonus, you can try to estimate the radius of curvature of the road as well.


### Phase 2 - Locate and Identify cars on the road
